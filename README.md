# AI-supported Market Analysis of Compensation & Benefits in M&A Integrations

## Introduction and Motivation

Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) create significant challenges for companies, particularly in aligning compensation and benefits systems between the merged organizations. PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH WPG (PwC), one of Germanyâ€™s leading auditing and consulting firms, frequently addresses this issue during post-merger integration, where different compensation structures must be harmonized. An objective and up-to-date overview of market compensation and benefits is essential to ensure fairness, maintain employee satisfaction, and support a smooth transition.

Job advertisements are a rich but unstructured source of data reflecting current market compensation and benefit trends across industries, regions, and company sizes. Extracting meaningful insights from this data requires automated, AI-supported methods capable of processing large volumes of textual information efficiently.

In collaboration with PwC, our project developed an **AI-based market analysis tool** that uses web scraping and natural language processing (NLP) to continuously collect, extract, and visualize compensation and benefits data from job advertisements. This tool provides PwC consultants with **evidence-based insights** to guide decision-making during post-merger integration.

## Project Tasks

The project was structured into three main tasks, distributed among the team:

1. **Data Source Identification and Web Scraping**  
   Identify accessible job advertisement sources and develop a reliable web scraping tool to enable continuous data extraction.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Pipeline**  
   Design and implement an NLP pipeline to extract structured information from unstructured job advertisement texts, including qualifications, compensations, and benefits.

3. **Comprehensive Survey of Compensation and Benefits Trends and Dashboard Development**  
   Conduct a literature review and empirical analysis of compensation and benefits trends to compare academic recommendations with market reality. Additionally, develop a dashboard to visualize and present the analyzed data effectively.
